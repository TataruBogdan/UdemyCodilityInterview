/* greedy algorithms are this class of algorithms.
* Sometimes you hear the term algorithm paradigm
* but basically there are this class of algorithms that enable you to solve a type of problem.
* Greece the algorithms we always make the best local choice and we do this with the aim of arriving to a global
* optimal solution.
* What does it mean to make the best local choice?
* It means that as you are going through your inputs you're making the decisions depending on that inputs
* Not the global picture.
* Imagine that we were a painter and we had a wall to paint and our problem is that we want to know how
* much paint we want to use on that wall
* to find the area of that wall we just do the height by the width of that area that we want to paint.
* And for one unit squared area right for example one meter squared area or one yard squared would need
* a one unit of paint.
* The problem that we are trying to solve is that for n unit squared area we want to find out how many
* buckets of paint that we need to buy.
* Now this would be easy if you could buy paint by the liter right by the volume.
* However if you go to a shop you can only buy paint in specific cans that have a specific volume.
* And the problem that we're trying to solve is that for an arbitrary unit of area we want to find out
* the choices that we want to make out of the available cans of paint.
* assume that you have these specific cans of paint available in your local shop
* you have a can with 6 units one with 23 and one with 1 unit.
* The idea is to minimize the number of cans that we want to buy.
* Typically a can with a bigger volume is cheaper by volume than a smaller one.
* Right so the bigger again that you buy the more money you are saving.
* Assume we have an area of 17 units squared which cans of paint. Do we need to buy?
* And the degree the algorithm to solve this problem is to start from the area of 17 Our input
* and we make the local choice
* we say which is the largest can that we can buy that fits in ?
