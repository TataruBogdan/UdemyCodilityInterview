/* selection sort algorithm.
* Now this algorithm divides the array into sorted and unsorted partitions
* And what we do is we traverse the array and we look for the largest element in the unsorted partition.
* And when we find it, we swap it with the last element in the unsorted partition.
* And at that point, that swapped element will be its correct sorted position.
* At the beginning of the algorithm, the entire array is unsorted so the last unsorted index is six
* we're going to grow the sorted partition from right to left. We're going to initialise a largest field to zero
* INNER LOOP
* so when we start we say you know what, 20 is the largest element that we know about so far,
* so whatever is at position zero will be the largest element.
* And we're going to start by comparing the element at position one to whatever is at position zero,
* We're going to use i to traverse the unsorted partition and find the largest element
* So we're going to compare 35 to 20 and we're gonna say hey, 35 is larger than 20 and because of that,
* we're going to change largest to one and then we're gonna increment i to two and we're gonna compare
* minus 15 to the largest element which is now at position one and we're gonna say well minus 15 is less than 35
* so we're just gonna increment i to three. We're gonna compare seven to the largest element which is still at
* position one. Seven is less than 35 so we just increment i to four. We're now gonna compare 55 to 35
* and 55 is greater than 35 so at this point we're going to change largest to four because the largest element
* we found so far  in the unsorted partition is at index four and we increment i to five....
* And at this point, i is equal to the last unsorted index and so we have completed our first traversal of the array.
* So we're going to swap the largest element that we found in the unsorted partition and that's at position four
* with the last element in the unsorted partition and that's at position six. swap 55 and minus 22
* 55 is in its correct sorted position and so we're gonna decrement last unsorted index to five
* and we're gonna re-initialize i to one and
* OUTER LOOP -> we're going to say the largest element in the unsorted partition
* is at position zero  repeat the process.
